# MacLin-2023-Modeling

This repository contains four different controllers using a reduced order model developed at the University of Iowa.

ctrl_PF = path following controller with standard autopilot  
ctrl_PF_ad = path following controller with adaptive controller and standard autopilot  
ctrl_TT = trajectory tracking controller with standard autopilot  
ctrl_TT_ad = trajectory tracking controller with adaptive controller and standard autopilot
